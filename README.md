# ClassicAutoIT

This is the codebase for a simple bot I had created for World of Wacraft Classic.  
Developed in [AutoIT](https://www.autoitscript.com/site/), a BASIC-like scripting language designed for automating the Windows GUI and general scripting.

You'll find a lot of hardcoded values and very little comments or documentation in this code: I built it for myself, not for public distribution.  
I built this for my own pleasure, as I find creating basic bots for video games incredibly fun.

There is no memory reading in this bot. Instead, I had built an helper add-on for the game, which displayed float or integer values as pixels of varying colors in a corner of the screen. That is how the player's coordinates, life, mana and experience information was passed to the bot. The same thing goes for the current target's health and mana. I thought that was fairly clever, and it worked quite well.

Enjoy! ☺️
