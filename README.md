# ClassicAutoIT

This is the codebase for a simple bot I had created for World of Wacraft Classic.  
Developed in [AutoIT](https://www.autoitscript.com/site/), a BASIC-like scripting language designed for automating the Windows GUI and general scripting.

You'll find a lot of hardcoded values and very little comments or documentation in this code: I built it for myself, not for public distribution.  
I built this for my own pleasure, as I find creating basic bots for video games incredibly fun.

Enjoy! ☺️
